    <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
    <p>
           <p>
         Hi Lath! Happy one year! 
</p> 
        A place is only as special as the person you share it with.
        </p>
Some of the most beautiful places I‚Äôve seen are tied to you. Or maybe they are the most beautiful because they are tied to you.
</p>
      Some of them are breathtaking: mountain views, open roads, dense forests. Others are completely ordinary: a swing, a field, a breakfast table. 
    But they have one thing in common- you were there. Or I was thinking of you. 
    Or something kutti reminded me of you.
    </p>  
    I made this map for two reasons:
  </p>
 1)  Because you, my darling girl, are a lover of maps.
</p>
2)  Because this world will take us many places.
 Some far apart, some side by side. But no matter where we go, 
I know you‚Äôll always show up: in a champu tree, a full laugh, a playfull pupper or an amber glassed bottle of olive oil.

</p>
How lucky am I, that even the most mundane places become memorable, solely because they remind me of you.
You are, truly, my favourite part of everywhere.
</p>
You mean the world to me, my lath. 
You are and always will be my bestest friend, my most desired company, and my favourite place to be.
        </p>
